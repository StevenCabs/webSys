			<h1>MY WORK PHILOSOPHY:</h1>
			<div class = "work-img"><img class = "imgThink" src="../imgs/thinking.jpg"></div>
			<p class= "work-phil">I always strive to be a better version of myself. I review my successes and evaluate my failures,
				always criticizing and improving on my decisions and actions. Effort may not always bear fruit,
				but progress will always be made as long as you keep trying.
			</p>
			<p class= "work-phil">I.T. might seem hard at first, but truthfully told, everything is. Programming is all about patterns and protocols.
				There is always a solution to everything, whether it be one line of code or a hundred of them. Once you have learned 
				the basics, it's all up to the you to utilize everything you have learned. And if you still need help, there are numerous programmers
				on the internet willing to share their knowledge.
